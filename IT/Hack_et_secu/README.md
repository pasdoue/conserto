## Installation/Deployment

- go to the folder where the Dockerfile is and launch this command

```shell
$ docker build -t conserto_chall .
```

- The image should be created without problem. However, when you launch the image you need to restart MySQL because of some "bug" not fixed for now

```shell
$ docker run -p 80:80 -td conserto_chall

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                        NAMES

$ docker exec -ti laughing_cray bash

(Press Ctrl+P and Ctrl+Q to exit docker image without killing it)
```

- Finally just launch inside your web browser the ip adress of your virtual machine or your PC to access to hacking challenges (http://your.complete.ip.address)

- Two challenges are not possible (lockpicking and the bomb as they need to be solved physically. They are both in miscellaneous section)
